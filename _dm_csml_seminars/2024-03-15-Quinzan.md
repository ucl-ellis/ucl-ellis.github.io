title: "Trustworthy AI: Exploring Causality and Generative Models for Better-Informed Predictions"
summary: "Recent successes of AI and Machine Learning have ignited a fast transfer of technology from research into products and government services. This phenomenon has created a range of problems, which can be broadly attributed to the interaction between technology and society. Examples of these problems are bias and unfairness, lack of robustness, and lack of transparency. In this talk, I will discuss some of the main challenges in Trustworthy AI, focusing on various applications, including data-driven health care and offline RL. I will argue that it is possible to design AI systems that are robust and capable of generalizing effectively, by uncovering the causal mechanisms of the underlying data generating process. I will also discuss how state-of-the-art generative models can be used on top of these techniques, to further enhance generalization performance. I will illustrate recent advancements in this field, and discuss possible future directions."
