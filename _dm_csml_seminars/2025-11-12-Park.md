title: "Causal and counterfactual spaces"
summary: "Since the work of Kolmogorov in 1933, probability theory has developed into a well-established subfield of mathematics, based on an (almost) universally accepted, measure-theoretic axiomatisation. However, causality and counterfactuals do not yet possess such universal mathematical axiomatisations, despite being arguably equally important concepts for the human intellect and a wide range of research domains. We propose causal and counterfactual spaces, which are mathematical axiomatisations of causality and counterfactuals based on measure theory. Our formalisms unify and generalise existing frameworks, and overcome their well-known limitations. Our hope is that they will provide a foundation for mathematical theories of causality and counterfactuals to develop, in the same role that probability spaces have played for the notion of randomness."
bio: "Junhyung is a postdoc at ETH Zurich, working with Fanny Yang. Previously, he obtained his PhD at MPI Tübingen under Krikamol Muandet and Bernhard Schölkopf, MSc Statistics at ETH Zurich under Sara van de Geer, and MMath and BA in mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He is interested in developing an axiomatic theory of causality."
