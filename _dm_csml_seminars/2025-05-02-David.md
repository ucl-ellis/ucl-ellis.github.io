title: "Gaussian processes and active learning: three recent chemistry-related developments"
summary: "In this talk, I will give an overview of three different research collaborations pertaining to Gaussian Process modelling and active learning algorithms applied to chemistry-related challenges. In particular, I will present recent work on targeted sequential design for uncovering high-activity molecules under precise and imprecise measurements schemes, and also present fast approaches to encode stochastic equivariances within kernel methods."
bio: "I am heading the Uncertainty Quantification and Spatial Statistics Group and serving as Director of Studies in Statistics at the University of Bern, where I am co-directing the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science."
