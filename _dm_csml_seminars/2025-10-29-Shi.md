title: "Statistics-powered Artifical Intelligence"
summary: "Abstract: We have definitely entered an era of generative artificial intelligence (AI), where large language models (LLMs) are increasingly reshaping our daily lives. Their impact is everywhere -- from education and academia to professional work and everyday life. In this talk, I will present two recent NeurIPS papers on statistics-powered AI, focusing on how statistical methodologies can enhance AI's performance in (1) aligning LLM's model outputs with human feedback, and (2) detecting LLM-generated content with rigorous guarantees. Open-source Python implementations are available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT and https://github.com/DRPO4LLM/DRPO4LLM."
