title: "Rough kernel hedging"
summary: " I will present a framework for hedging a portfolio of exotic derivatives using modern kernel methods for time series. Parameterizing hedging strategies as points in the RKHS of carefully designed operator-valued kernels, I will explain how the solution to the original stochastic optimisation problem can be provably recovered by solving a ridge regression on observed market trajectories. Joint work with Nicola M. Cirone."
