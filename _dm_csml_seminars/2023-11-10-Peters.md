title: "Instrumental Time Series and Effect-Invariance for Policy Generalization"
summary: "We present two different works that have recently helped us when
analyzing real-world data: the first paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06056 considers the problem of
instrumental variables in a vector auto-regressive setting; the second
paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10983 introduces effect-invariance, which can help to learn policies
that generalize better between subjects."
