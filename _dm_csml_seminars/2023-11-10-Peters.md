title: "Instrumental Time Series and Effect-Invariance for Policy Generalization"
summary: "We present two different works that have recently helped us when
analyzing real-world data: the first paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06056 considers the problem of
instrumental variables in a vector auto-regressive setting; the second
paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10983 introduces effect-invariance, which can help to learn policies
that generalize better between subjects."
bio: "Jonas is interested in using different types of data to predict the
effect of interventions and to build statistical methods that are robust
with respect to distributional shifts. He seeks to combine theory and
methodology and tries to let real world applications guide his research.
His work relates to areas such as causal inference, distribution
generalization, dynamical systems, policy learning, graphical models,
and independence testing. Since 2023, Jonas is professor in statistics
at ETH Zurich. Previously, he has been a professor at the Department of
Mathematical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen and a group leader
at the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tuebingen. He
studied Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg and the University
of Cambridge and obtained his PhD jointly from MPI and ETH."
