title: "Free Energy Estimation"
summary: "Free energy estimation is a fundamental challenge in machine learning (normalization factors) and statistical physics (partition functions) with broad applications in science. In this talk, we describe a new framework for estimating the free energy difference between two systems via a learned non-equilibrium transport. Our approach yields variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences, alongside a consistent, minimum-variance estimator. Our approach unifies equilibrium averages and non-equilibrium transports under a single framework, and achieves significant improvements over existing neural network methods."
