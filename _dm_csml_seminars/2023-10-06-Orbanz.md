title: "Learning functions with crystallographic symmetries"
summary: "The symmetries of crystals, periodic tilings and similar repetitive geometries are described by a class of groups called crystallographic groups. Motivated by problems in materials science, I will explain how to obtain a representation of continuous functions invariant under such a group, (1) by factoring through a structure that geometers call an orbifold and (2) by a certain generalization of the Fourier transform. This representation is constructive, can be implemented algorithmically, and allows us to construct machine learning models with crystallographic symmetries, such as neural networks, kernel machines, and Gaussian processes.
