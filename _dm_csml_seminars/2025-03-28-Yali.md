title: "Towards Cooperative AI"
summary: "From collaborative industrial robots to personal AI assistants, the integration of AI into our daily lives highlights the critical need for effective and reliable coordination among agents, as well as between agents and humans. This challenge centers on creating agents that not only align with user intentions but also possess the flexibility to adapt to evolving circumstances, such as the introduction of novel agents. The pursuit of multi-agent cooperation extends beyond individual interactions to encompass broader societal considerations. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges of cooperative AI, and our contributions on multi-agent cooperation, human-ai coordination and cooperative alignments."
bio: "Dr Yali Du is a Senior Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Informatics at Kingâ€™s College London. She leads the Cooperative AI Lab. Her research aims to enable machines to exhibit cooperative and responsible behaviour in intelligent decision making tasks. Her work focuses on reinforcement learning and multi-agent cooperation, with topics such as generalization, zero-shot coordination, evaluation of human and AI players, and social agency (e.g. human-involved learning, safety and ethics). She was chosen for the AAAI New Faculty Highlights award (2023), Rising Star in AI 2023. She has given tutorials on cooperative multi-agent learning at ACML 2022 and AAAI 2023. She serves as the editor for the Journal of AAMAS and IEEE Transactions on AI, and is part of the organising committee for AAMAS 2023. Her research is also supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UKRI-EPSRC)."
