title: "Tuning-Free Sampling via Optimisation on the Space of Probability Measures"
summary: "The task of sampling from a target probability distribution known only up to a normalisation constant is of fundamental importance to computational statistics and machine learning. There are various popular approaches to this task, including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI). Unfortunately, such methods invariably depend on hyper-parameters such as the step size, which must be carefully tuned by practitioners in order to ensure convergence to the target distribution at a suitable rate. In this talk, we introduce a suite of new sampling algorithms which are entirely step-size free. Our approach leverages the perspective of sampling as an optimisation problem over the space of probability measures, and existing ideas from convex optimisation. We discuss how to establish the convergence of our algorithms under assumptions on the target distribution. We then illustrate the performance of our approach on a range of numerical examples, demonstrating comparable performance to existing algorithms, but with no need to tune a step size."
