description: "Ilija Bogunovic serves as an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning Systems Engineering. His research is centered around algorithmic decision-making within the realms of reliable, aligned, and safe AI. Specifically, he delves into the algorithmic challenges of efficiently making decisions and discovering policies, designs, and solutions that can withstand distributional shifts (sim-to-real gap), corruptions, adversaries, and model misspecifications. His work explores how to harness the potential of foundation models to facilitate robust and aligned decision-making. Additionally, within the context of real-world machine learning, he investigates how reliability and robustness considerations can be integrated into interactive data-driven algorithms, encompassing areas such as RL and RLHF, Bayesian optimization/experiment design (AI for science), and multi-agent learning."
