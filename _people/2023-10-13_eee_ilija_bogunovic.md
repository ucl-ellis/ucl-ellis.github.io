description: "Ilija Bogunovic is an Assistant Professor (or UK Lecturer) in Machine Learning Systems Engineering. His research focuses on algorithmic decision-making in the context of robust, reliable, and safe AI. More specifically, his interest lies in the questions of: how to efficiently make decisions and discover policies, designs, and solutions that can withstand distributional shifts (sim-to-real gap), corruptions, adversaries, and model misspecifications; How can to exploit the potential of foundation models to facilitate robust and aligned decision-making; how, in the context of real-world machine learning, reliability and robustness considerations can be realized within interactive data-driven algorithms (for reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization/experiment design and multi-agent learning)."
