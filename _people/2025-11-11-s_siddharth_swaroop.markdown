description: Siddharth Swaroop is a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Computer Science. His research focusses on understanding and adapting knowledge in machine learning models. This focus has two parts: designing new, more efficient, machine learning (ML) methods, and investigating the human and social impact of adapting ML models. More specifically, (1) he uses a probabilistic framework to unify different knowledge-adaptation tasks (such as continual learning and federated learning), in order to design improved algorithms; and (2) he improves performance of human-AI teams by adapting ML systems to different humans in human-computer interaction (HCI), as well as translates AI policies into technical requirements for ML systems.
