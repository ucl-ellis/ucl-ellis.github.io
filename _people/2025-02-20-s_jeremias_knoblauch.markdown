description: Jeremias Knoblauch is an Associate Professor of Statistical Science. Jeremias' research revolves around extending the paradigm of Bayesian inference to cope with the challenges posed by modern large-scale data, simulator models, and machine learning techniques. In this context, he is particularly interested in generalised and Post-Bayesian inference, model misspecification and robustification strategies, computational challenges involving intractability, and variational methods.
