title: Workshop on "Computational Statistics and Machine Learning in the Sciences"
summary: On Tuesday 5th December, the ELLIS unit co-hosted an event on ‘Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) in the Sciences’ with around 80 attendees. This took place at the London Mathematical Society, and was co-organised by the UCL Statistical Science’ CSML research theme, the UCL Centre for Data Science, and the UCL ELLIS unit. The aim of the event was to increase interactions between researchers working on CSML within the UCL ELLIS unit. It included a broad range of talks highlighting exciting methodological advances in MCMC, simulation-based inference and robust optimisation, but also applications of CSML methods in genetics, cosmology, and medical imaging.
